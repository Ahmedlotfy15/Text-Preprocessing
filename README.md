# Text Preprocessing: Removing Stopwords in English and Arabic

## Introduction

This notebook demonstrates text preprocessing by removing stopwords in both English and Arabic using popular libraries like `NLTK`, `spaCy`, and `Arabic-Stopwords`. The process involves:
- Tokenizing the text into words.
- Filtering out common stopwords such as "the" in English and "من" in Arabic.
- Customizing stopword lists, particularly in `spaCy`.
- Working with Arabic stopwords using the `Arabic-Stopwords` library.

These techniques are beneficial for text analysis, classification tasks, and improving machine learning models by reducing noise and enhancing model accuracy in natural language processing tasks.
