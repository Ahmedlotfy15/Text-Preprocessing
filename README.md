# Text Preprocessing Techniques: Stopwords Removal, Stemming, and Lemmatization

## Introduction
This repository contains two comprehensive notebooks that demonstrate key techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for preprocessing textual data. These techniques include **stopwords removal**, **stemming**, and **lemmatization** for both English and Arabic languages. Preprocessing helps in reducing noise, normalizing text, and improving the efficiency of machine learning models for NLP tasks.

## Notebooks

### 1. Stopwords Removal in English and Arabic
**Filename:** `text-preprocessing-stopwords-removal-in-english-and-arabic.ipynb`

This notebook focuses on the removal of stopwords (common words that do not contribute much to the meaning) in English and Arabic texts using libraries like **NLTK**, **spaCy**, and **Arabic-Stopwords**.

#### Key Highlights:
- Demonstrates tokenization and stopword removal in English using **NLTK**.
- Custom stopword handling in **spaCy**.
- Arabic stopword processing using the **Arabic-Stopwords** library.
- Provides customizable stopword lists for both languages.

#### Example Use Cases:
- Removing noise in textual datasets.
- Preprocessing steps for tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis.

### 2. Stemming and Lemmatization
**Filename:** `text-preprocessing-techniques-stemming-lemmatization.ipynb`

This notebook delves into the techniques of **stemming** (reducing words to their roots) and **lemmatization** (reducing words to their dictionary form). It includes implementations for both **English** and **Arabic** text.
